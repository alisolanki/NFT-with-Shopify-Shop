# NFT-with-Shopify-Shop

With this, you can connect your shopify store to your NFT collection to give the users NFTs whenever they purchase something from your store.

You would have to add some changes to the Shopify store as well, like collecting the user's Wallet Address on checkout and passing it over.

Change the ```.env.example``` file to ```.env``` and add your secret keys there.
Run ```npm install``` in the terminal.
Run ```npm run dev``` in order to run the app. (When you purchase/interact with your Shopify store, make sure to keep this app running preferably on a server)
